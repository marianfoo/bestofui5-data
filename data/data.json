Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-cfdestination\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-cfdestination\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-cfdestination\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        authenticationMethod: \"none\" # \"none\" || \"route\", default: \"none\"\n        allowServices: true # allows BTP services like SAP IoT to be used \n        debug: true\n        port: 1091\n        xsappJson: \"xs-app.json\"\n        destinations:\n          # check that the destination name (here: \"backend\") matches your router in xs-app.json\n          - name: \"backend\"\n            url: \"https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(fdng4tbvlxgzpdtpfap2rqss))/TripPinServiceRW/\"\n```\n\n3. put the cf routing config file `xs-app.json` in the location of `$yourapp` you specified above (`xsappJson`) -  \nrecommendation is to put it at the root `/` of your UI5 app!\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware wraps the `@sap/approuter` npm module that is used in the SAP BTP CloudFoundry environment for serving UI5 applications, including proxying the configured destinations.\n\nDuring development, the `approuter` is started on a configurable port, running alongside the regular local `ui5-server`. When a call to a URL destination is detected at `$webserver/destination`, it is proxied to `$approuter:$port` via [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request).\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n**q**: does authentication on destinations  \n**a**: yes, works 🥳\n\n- prerequisite: a `default-env.json` file at the root `/` of your UI5 app\nBespoken `default-env.json` file can be obtained [via the `Default Env CLI Plugin`](https://github.com/saphanaacademy/DefaultEnv)\n- `ui5.yaml > server > customMiddlware > ui5-middleware-cfdestination`: set `authenticationMethod` to `route` (see config example above)\n- `xs-app.json` (also at the root `/` of your UI5 app):\n  - set `authenticationMethod` to `route`\n  - in the route with the desired protected authentication, set `authenticationType` to `xsuaa`  \n\nsee `./test/auth/**/*` for example files for the above!\n\n**q**: what's `allowLocalDir` for?  \n**a**: allows to protect local static assets (e.g. `html` files) -in addition to destinations- with approuter as well.  \nsee `test/auth/xs-app-with-localDir.json` for an example!\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

It transmits user interactions of the UI via a websocket pool. Respectively, all browsers connected to `http://ui5-app:port` open a websocket connection, listening for and receiving interactions events.  \n\nAdditionally, `iasync` injects custom HTML into `index.html`, manipulating browser event handlers of UI5 controls - see `lib/ui5mangler.html`. E.g. the `sap.m.Button`'s click event is overwritten with its' tap event.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n> Watch Out!  \n> Due to manipulation of the UI5 controls (see above), interactions of the UI might lead to unexpected results!\n\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for delivering a welcome/start/'index' page to the client\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the `$index.html` of choice (instead of the directory listing).\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-index --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- index: `<string>`, default: `index.html`  \n  file inside `$yourapp` to deliver for `http://<host>:<port>/`\n- debug: `<boolean>`, default: `false`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-index\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-index\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array.

The reload is `#`-aware, meaning the current displayed route in your single-page UI5 app is kept steady.\n\n## HTTP/2 support\n\nThe middleware supports HTTP/2 automatically, when the UI5 server is started with the --h2 option. It uses the same SSL key and certificate, either set using the --key and --cert options, or using the default ~/.ui5/server/server.key and ~/.ui5/server/server.crt.\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\nyep, cross-browser, cross-platform.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for live transpiling ES6+ sources\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing on-the-fly transpilation of ES6+ sources to ES5 (incl IE11 compatability :) )\n\n:warning: The `ui5-middleware-livetranspile` has been deprecated and replaced with the `ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware`. Please check out the tooling extensions from [ui5-tooling-transpile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-transpile).\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-livetranspile --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \nverbose logging\n\n- excludePatterns: `String<Array>`  \narray of paths inside `$yourapp/webapp/` to exclude from live transpilation,  \ne.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`\n\n- transpileAsync: `true|false`  \ntranspiling `async/await`  using [this Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises), which doesn't require  \nthe regenerator runtime ([Issue #242](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/issues/242))\n\n- babelConfig: `Object`  \nobject to use as configuration for babel instead of the default configuration  \ndefined in this middleware\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-livetranspile\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-livetranspile\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livetranspile\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      transpileAsync: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware intercepts every `.js`-file before it is sent to the client. The file is then transpiled on-the-fly via `babel`, including dynamic creation of a `sourcemap`.\n\nThe transpiled code and the `sourcemap` are subsequently delivered to the client instead of the original `.js`-file. Because of the `sourcemap`, setting breakpoints in the **original (ES6+) source** will cause the debugger to stop **when the corresponding transpiled source code is reached**.\n\n> `async/await` is transpiled at runtime, but the required `asyncGenerator` sources are not yet delivered on the fly. They need to be `sap.ui.require`d or `<script src=\"...\">`d separately. Alternatively you can use the babel plugin `babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises` as described [here](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Extending the default configuration (in `$yourapp/babel.config.json`)\n\nIf you want to further customize the transpiling options you can do so by creating a babel config file `babel.config.json` in your project directory. The behavior is identical to that of `ui5-task-transpile`. For more details and examples consult the [documentation of `ui5-task-transpile`](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Override babel configuration (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nYou can override the default babel configuration from this package by including an object `babelConfig` in this task's configuration. The behavior is identical to that of `ui5-task-transpile`. For more details and examples consult the [documentation of `ui5-task-transpile`](../ui5-task-transpile/README.md).\n\n## Misc/FAQ\n\n`.js`-files requested by the server that are missing in the application (such as `Component-preload.js`) are logged as a `WARN` message, but will not cause the middleware to break/stop.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

Another workaround is to set debug and useCertificate to true in the configuration and press ok when the prompt opens\n\nYou can either add the following properties to your .env file, remember to add that to your .gitignore\n\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_LOGIN_URL or UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_USERNAME\n- UI5_MIDDLEWARE_ONELOGIN_PASSWORD\n\nUse of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will be used.\n\nOther options is to either set it in the yaml file or if left blank it will prompt you for the details.\n\nYou can choose to just add the url and let the rest be prompted in the terminal\n![Login prompt](./assets/prompt.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-onelogin\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-onelogin\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-onelogin\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        path: <Login URL>\n        username: <Login User>\n        password: <Login Password>\n        useCertificate: true / false (use a certificate to login instead of username and password)\n        debug: true / false (true will open up the playwright browser so you can see what's going

UI5 simple proxy middleware\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), enabling proxy support.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-simpleproxy --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- baseUri: `string`\n  The baseUri to proxy. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI` environment variable.\n- strictSSL: `boolean`\n  Ignore strict SSL checks. Default value `true`. Can also be set using the `UI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL` environment variable.\n- limit: `string`\n  This sets the body size limit (default: `1mb`). If the body size is larger than the specified (or default) limit,\n  a `413 Request Entity Too Large`  error will be returned. See [bytes.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) for\n  a list of supported formats.\n- removeETag:  `boolean`\n  Removes the ETag header from the response to avoid conditional requests.\n- username:  `string`\n  Username used for Basic Authentication.\n- password:  `string`\n  Password used for Basic Authentication.\n- httpHeaders: `map`\n  Http headers set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the http headers from the request. \n- query: `map`\n  Query parameters set for the proxied request. Will overwrite the parameters from the request. \n- excludePatterns: `string[]`\n  Array of exclude patterns using glob syntax\n- skipCache: `boolean`\n  Remove the cache guid when serving from the FLP launchpad if it matches an excludePattern\n\nIn general, use of environment variables or values set in a `.env` file will override configuration values in the `ui5.yaml`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"https://services.odata.org\"\n      username: myUsername\n      password: myPassword\n      httpHeaders:\n        Any-Header: AnyHeader\n      query:\n        sap-client: '206'\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"/local/**\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware launches a simple `proxy`-server which proxies the requests to the given uri. Internally, it uses the express proxy middleware.\n\n## How to ignore self-signed certificates?\n\nIn case you are using HTTPS and self-signed certificates, you may see an error as displayed below:\n\n```bash\nError: unable to verify the first certificate\n    at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (_tls_wrap.js:1321:34)\n    at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:210:5)\n    at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:794:8)\n    at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (_tls_wrap.js:608:12)\n```\n\nTo avoid it, you can set the `strictSSL` value in proxy request to be `false`. Its default value is `true`.\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n    mountPath: /odata\n    configuration:\n      baseUri: \"http://services.odata.org\"\n      strictSSL: false\n```\n\n## .env support\n\nThis plugin supports use of a `.env` file to declare environment variable values for configuration as described above. The file should be put in the same directory where you run `ui5 build`, `ui5 serve`, etc. The file might have contents like:\n\n```shell\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_BASEURI=https://host.tld:1234/sap\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_STRICT_SSL=false\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_USERNAME=myUsername\nUI5_MIDDLEWARE_SIMPLE_PROXY_PASSWORD=myPassword\n```\n\n## Hints\n\nIf you are using the Microsoft OData services for testing purposes, like Northwind, please ensure to use the `https` URLs instead of the `http` URLs. The `http` URL will redirect to `https` but instead of the proxy it will try to directly connect to the Microsoft OData services.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 middleware for live string replace in files\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), doing a live string replace on files matched by the includePatterns `files` array configuration option.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm install ui5-middleware-stringreplacer --save-dev\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm add --save-dev ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add --dev ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: true|false  \n  verbose logging\n- files: `string`|`array`  \n  Placeholders will be replaced with their values in files matched by this glob pattern\n- replace: `array`  \n  List of placeholder, value pairs\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-middleware-stringreplacer\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n      configuration:\n        debug: true\n        files:\n          - \"**/*.js\"\n          - \"**/*.xml\"\n        replace:\n          - placeholder: ${project.artifactId}\n            value: my.sample.app\n          - placeholder: ${project.version}\n            value: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n          - placeholder: \"{{app.AppTitle}}\"\n            value: My Sample App\n```\n\n3. Maintain all string placeholders and values in `.env` file\n\n```env\nstringreplacer.BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER = http://localhost:2000\nstringreplacer.some.deeply.nested.ANOTHER_PLACEHOLDER = Replace with this text\n```\n\n## Multiple environments\n\nYou can keep multiple `.env` files and load a specific environment at build or serve time.\n\n```\n- dev.env\n- staging.env\n- prod.env\n- package.json\n```\n\n```json\n \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve:dev\": \"UI5_ENV=dev ui5 serve\",\n    \"serve:staging\": \"UI5_ENV=staging ui5 serve\",\n    \"serve:prod\": \"UI5_ENV=prod ui5 serve\",\n }\n```\n\nWith `UI5_ENV` set, the strings will be loaded from the `<UI5_ENV>.env` file.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe middleware replaces the placeholders with their values in the files matched by the patterns. All the string placeholders which are maintained in the process environment with prefix 'stringreplacer.' will be taken into account. If no environment name is set through the process environment variable UI5_ENV, then by default the file`./.env` is loaded.\n","jsdoc":{},"downloadsCurrentMonth":415,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":178,"downloads365":2071,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-24.89,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":111},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":77},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":153},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":94},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":191},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":213},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":256},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":119},{"yearMonth":"2022-08","downloads":119},{"yearMonth":"2022-09","downloads":188},{"yearMonth":"2022-10","downloads":202}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2020-09-29T12:13:09.886Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/created"},{"version":"0.2.0","date":"2020-09-29T12:13:10.120Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.0"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-06-26T10:22:54.590Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/modified"},{"version":"0.2.1","date":"2021-01-06T07:54:13.960Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.1"},{"version":"0.2.2","date":"2021-05-05T19:24:40.402Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.2"},{"version":"0.2.3","date":"2021-08-07T20:04:24.142Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.3"},{"version":"0.2.4","date":"2021-09-29T18:46:38.369Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.4"},{"version":"0.2.5","date":"2021-10-29T20:23:05.391Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.2.5"},{"version":"0.3.0","date":"2021-12-26T09:54:44.907Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.0"},{"version":"0.3.1","date":"2022-02-22T20:21:33.834Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.1"},{"version":"0.3.2","date":"2022-02-24T20:28:10.911Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.2"},{"version":"0.3.3","date":"2022-04-11T11:40:06.998Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.3"},{"version":"0.3.4","date":"2022-04-19T08:29:47.070Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.4"},{"version":"0.3.5","date":"2022-05-22T20:38:46.463Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.5"},{"version":"0.3.6","date":"2022-05-23T07:04:02.230Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.6"},{"version":"0.3.7","date":"2022-06-03T20:09:36.559Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.3.7"},{"version":"0.4.0","date":"2022-06-22T05:38:20.318Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.4.0"},{"version":"0.4.1","date":"2022-06-26T10:22:54.513Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-stringreplacer/v/0.4.1"}]},{"name":"ui5-middleware-webjars","version":"0.4.0","description":"UI5 middleware for delivering content from JAR files","author":"Volker Buzek, Peter Muessig","license":"other","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase.git","directory":"packages/ui5-middleware-webjars"},"scripts":{"lint":"eslint lib"},"dependencies":{"@ui5/logger":"^2.0.1","@ui5/server":"^2.4.0","jszip":"^3.10.0"},"ui5":{"dependencies":[]},"type":"middleware","tags":["webjars"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"ui5-ecosystem-showcase","forks":63,"stars":152,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-09T11:37:57.868Z","createdAt":"2021-01-25T13:38:21.321Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-22T05:38:21.198Z","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/main/packages/ui5-middleware-webjars/","readme":"# UI5 middleware for delivering content from JAR files\n\nMiddleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the content of JAR files.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-middleware-webjars --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- classpathFile: `string`\n\n  the file containing the classpath (list of files, separated with the path delimiter) which can be created via:\n\n  > `mvn clean dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.cpFile=target/classpath`\n\n- rootPath: `string`\n\n  the root path to the static resources on your system\n\n- jarRootPath: `string`, default: `META-INF/resources/`\n\n  the root path in the JAR file containing the static resources\n\n- debug: `boolean`, default: `false`\n\n## Usage\n\n1.

By default, this allows to consume static resources from the JAR files from within the `META-INF/resources/` path. When using JAR files following a derived web static resources concept it is possible to override the JAR root path with the configuration `jarRootPath`.\n\n```text\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/resources/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n\n---\njarRootPath: \"META-INF/\"\n\nMETA-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `ui5-middleware-webjars`, please use [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io) for code formatting/style and apply the rules from `./.prettierrc`.

Possible values are\n\n* `Offline-Page` The App will display a offline page when it cannot connect to the internet. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Offline-Copy` While browsing the App, the Service Worker captures all files and stores them in the cache.\n* `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page` A combination of the above two. Requires `offlinePage` parameter.\n* `Cache-First` This option pre-caches all given files and serves them from the cache first. Requires `preCacheFiles` parameter.\n* `Advanced-Caching` With this option you have very granular control about which files should be cached, and which shouldn't. Requires all of the parameters below.\n\n`offlinePage`: Sets the page that will be shown if the user is offline, should be a `.html` file somewhere in your project. Only required for `Offline-Page`, `Offline-Copy-With-Backup-Page`, `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`preCache`: List of [glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) that match the files that will be pre cached when the application starts. Only required for `Cache-First` and `Advanced-Caching` strategies.\n\n`networkFirst`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions will be fetched from the network first and only served from cache when there is no network available. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`.\n\n`avoidCaching`: List of regular expressions, everything that matches any of the expressions won't be cached. Only required for `Advanced-Caching`\n\n### `manifest`\n\nWhatever you supply here will be copied to the `manifest.webmanifest` file, you can read more about it at [web.dev](https://web.dev/add-manifest/). If a required parameter is missing a default value will be provided.\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Define the dependency in your `package.json`\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"ui5-task-pwa-enabler\": \"*\"\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n    \"dependencies\": [\n        \"ui5-task-pwa-enabler\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure it in your `ui5.yaml`\n\nThis is a example configuration for an advanced service worker and some custom manifest parameters.\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: '1.0'\nmetadata:\n  name: openui5-sample-app\ntype: application\nresources:\n  configuration:\n    propertiesFileSourceEncoding: \"UTF-8\"\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-pwa-enabler\n      afterTask: generateVersionInfo\n      configuration:\n        serviceWorker:\n          strategy: Advanced-Caching\n          offlinePage: offline.html\n          preCache:\n            - \"controller/*\"\n            - \"*.html\"\n            - \"view/*\"\n            - \"images/*\"\n          networkFirst:\n            - /\\/api\\/.*/\n          avoidCaching:\n            - /\\/realtime-api\\/.*/\n        manifest:\n          short_name: To-Do App\n          name: To-Do App\n          description: Sample to-do-app for testing pwaEnabler\n          icons:\n            - src: images/SAP_R_192.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 192x192\n            - src: images/SAP_R_512.png\n              type: image/png\n              sizes: 512x512\n          start_url: /index.html\n          scope: /\n          background_color: \"#EFF4F9\"\n          theme_color: \"#3F5161\"\n          display: standalone\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nUnder the hood we are using the examples from the [pwabuilder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-serviceworkers)\nbut we replaced the configuration part with templating and generate those values from the provided configuration.\nAdditionally we have to inject a few lines into the `index.html` to make sure everything is linked and tadaa, you have\nyour own fancy PWA.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

Please check out the tooling extensions from [ui5-tooling-transpile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-transpile).\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-task-transpile --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- debug: `true|false`  \n  verbose logging\n\n- removeConsoleStatements: `true|false`  \n  remove console statements while transpiling using [Babel plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console)\n\n- excludePatterns: `String<Array>`  \n  array of paths inside `$yourapp/webapp/` to exclude from live transpilation,  \n  e.g. 3-rd party libs in `lib/*`\n\n- transpileAsync: `true|false`  \n  transpiling `async/await` using [this Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises), which doesn't require  \n  the regenerator runtime ([Issue #242](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/issues/242))\n\n- babelConfig: `Object`\n  object to use as configuration for babel instead of the  \n  default configuration defined in this middleware\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-transpile\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-task-transpile\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-task-transpile\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\n    configuration:\n      debug: true\n      removeConsoleStatements: true\n      transpileAsync: true\n      excludePatterns:\n      - \"lib/\"\n      - \"another/dir/in/webapp\"\n      - \"yet/another/dir\"\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe task can be used to transpile ES6+ JavaScript code to ES5 by using `babel`.\n\n## Extending the default configuration (in `$yourapp/babel.config.json`)\n\nIf you want to further customize the transpiling options you can do so by creating a babel config file `babel.config.json` in your project directory. Babel will automatically pick up the configuration and apply it. The default configuration from this task will still be applied.\n\n### Example\n\nAn example configuration is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-for-of\", { \"assumeArray\": true }],\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-computed-properties\", { \"loose\": true }],\n    [\"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring\", { \"loose\": true }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nIf you need dependencies not included in this task you have to install them in your project in order to be able to use them.\n\n## Override babel configuration (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\nYou can override the default babel configuration from this package by including an object `babelConfig` in this task's configuration. If such an object is given the default configuration from this task will not be considered, but only the configuration given in `ui5.yaml` will be used.\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-task-transpile\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n      configuration:\n        excludePatterns:\n          - \"lib/\"\n        babelConfig: &babelConfig\n          plugins:\n            - - \"@babel/plugin-transform-computed-properties\"\n              - loose: true\n            - - \"@babel/plugin-transform-for-of\"\n              - assumeArray: true\n          presets:\n            - - \"@babel/preset-env\"\n              - targets:\n                  browsers: \"last 2 versions, ie 10-11\"\n```\n\n> Hint: if you also use use `ui5-middleware-livetranspile` you probably do not want to duplicate the babel configuration in your `ui5.yaml`. Use YAML anchors in order to reference the babel configuration across the `ui5.yaml` file.\n> In the example above the anchor `&babelConfig` defines the babel configuration of `ui5-task-transpile` and may be re-used in other parts of `ui5.yaml` by using the alias `*babelConfig`:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> server:\n>   customMiddleware:\n>   - name: ui5-middleware-livetranspile\n>     afterMiddleware: compression\n>     configuration:\n>       babelConfig:\n>         <<: *babelConfig\n>         sourceMaps: \"inline\"\n> ```\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nIf you need dependencies not included in this task you have to install them in your project in order to be able to use them.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 Tooling Extensions for NPM Package Consumption\n\n> **DISCLAIMER**: This is a community project and there is no official support for this package! Also the functionality may stop working at any time in future with newer versions of the UI5 tooling!\n\nThe UI5 tooling extensions include a custom middleware and a custom task which allow to use NPM package names for AMD-like dependencies, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n# Install a dev dependency to Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)\nnpm install chart.js\n```\n\n```js\n// use Chart.js as a AMD-like dependency\nsap.ui.define([\n  \"chart.js\"\n], function(chartjs) {\n  [...]\n  alert(chartjs.version);\n  [...]\n})\n```\n\nOnce the UI5 application is finally built, the Chart.js dependency will be copied into the `dist/resources` folder with the proper namespace. In case of Chart.js above, there is no namespace and thus the location will be `dist/resources/chart.js.js`.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ui5-tooling-modules --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)\n\n- *verbose*: `boolean`  \n  Enables verbose logging (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *prependPathMappings*: `boolean`  \n  Prepends the path mappings for the UI5 loader to the `Component.js` which allows to run the Component using 3rd party modules in e.g. Fiori launchpad environments (defaults to `false`)\n  &nbsp;\n\n- *addToNamespace*: `boolean`\n  Puts 3rd party modules into the namespace of the Component to make them Component-local. All used 3rd party modules will be moved into the sub-namespace `thirdparty` of the Component namespace at build time. With that option you can run your application using 3rd party modules in a Fiori launchpad environment. (defaults to `false`, disables *prependPathMappings* when set to `true`)\n  &nbsp;\n  > :warning: While this works great for any non-UI5 3rd party module, there are limitations for the consumption of UI5 modules from custom control 3rd party modules (NPM packages). The UI5 module names (used for `Object.extend(...)`, aggregation types, ...) are not rewritten and this may cause issues. UI5 assumes that the used module path (slash syntax) is matching the module name (dot syntax). This can lead to issues for `Object.isA(...)` checks, Renderer lookups (when not inlined or referenced by module), or for any other API which derives the module name from the module path or vice versa.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-modules\": \"*\"\n    // ...\n},\n\"ui5\": {\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    // ...\n    \"ui5-tooling-modules\",\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> As the devDependencies are not recognized by the UI5 tooling, they need to be listed in the `ui5 > dependencies` array. In addition, once using the `ui5 > dependencies` array you need to list all UI5 tooling relevant dependencies.\n\n2. Configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:\n\nThe configuration for the custom task:\n\n```yaml\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-task\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\n```\n\nThe configuration for the custom middleware:\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n    - name: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware\n      afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\n> :warning: In case your application is using a proxy such `fiori-tools-proxy`, the proxy must run after `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` middleware. Otherwise proxy will try to serve the resources for your installed npm package instead of `ui5-tooling-modules-middleware`. You can achieve this by setting `afterMiddleware: ui5-tooling-modules-middleware` in `fiori-tools-proxy` middleware.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe custom middleware is listening to incoming requests and checks those requests to match npm packages. E.g. a dependency to `chart.js` will cause a request to `resource/chart.js.js`. The middleware now derives the module name which is `\"chart.js\"` and uses `require.resolve(\"chart.js\")` to lookup the npm package for it. If an npm package exists, the middleware is using `rollup` to create a custom AMD bundle for the npm package which uses `sap.ui.define` instead of `define`.\n\nThe custom task is scanning all AMD dependencies of all modules and tries to resolve the module names. If a module has been found a custom bundle will be created in the proper namespace of the module, e.g. `@apollo/client/core` will create a custom bundle at `dist/resources/@apollo/client/core.js`.\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this showcase will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

UI5 custom control `ui5-cc-md`\n\nThis namespace contains a custom control rendering regular + github-flavored Markdown content, either provided as a string or from a file.  \nIt outputs plain HTML, ready to be included in an XML view.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$> yarn add ui5-cc-md\n# or\n$> npm install ui5-cc-md\n```\n\n## Included controls\n\n- `Markdown`: transforms Markdown to HTML\n  - properties: (note: either `content` or `fromFile` can be used, not both)\n    - `content: <String>`: Markdown as raw string\n    - `fromFile: <Path>`: relative path to a file containing Markdwon\n  - aggregations: -\n\n## Usage\n\n1. define the dependeny in `$yourapp/package.json`\n\n   ```json\n   // it is already in \"dependencies\" after installation\n   \"ui5\": {\n     \"dependencies\": [\n       // ...\n       \"ui5-cc-md\",\n       // ...\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. declare the namespace in your XML view and use the custom control from that namespace\n\n   ```xml\n   <mvc:View ... \n           xmlns:md=\"cc.md\"\n           ...>\n      <md:Markdown content=\"***markdown is nice!***&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;if only there wasn't the CR problem in XML view string\" />\n      <md:Markdown fromFile=\"./fragment.md\" />\n      <md:Markdown content=\"{/markdownContent}\" />\n   </mvc:View>\n   ```\n\n## How it works\n\n`Markdown` uses the [npm module `marked`](https://marked.js.org) for transforming content from Markdown to HTML.\n\n## Build time (in apps)\n\nUse `ui5 build --all` to produce a deployable version of your app including `ui5-cc-md` and its’ control(s).\n\nOther than that, nothing specific to note for using `ui5-cc-md` in builds in UI5 apps.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe `test` folder contains a minimal UI5 app requiring `ui5-cc-md`. \n\nFor testing manually, do:\n\n```bash\n$> yarn test:manual # runs ui5 serve\n# now point a browser to http://localhost:8080\n```\n\nThe [livereload middleware](https://github.com/petermuessig/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/master/packages/ui5-middleware-livereload) is included, so changes to the test app get reloaded immediately.\n\nA full automated test suite is setup with [Jest + puppeteer](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer), starting `ui5 serve` and running all `/test/**/*.test.js` :\n\n```bash\n$> cd test/ui5-app\n$> yarn # for installing runtime dependencies\n$> cd ..\n$> yarn test\n# sample output:\n PASS  test/ui5-app/basic.test.js\n  Markdown\n    ✓ should render markdown via content property (2374 ms)\n    ✓ should render markdown

official UI5 tooling and support multiple deployment targets such as the SAP Business Technology Platform. This generator was build as a plug-in for the community project [Easy-UI5](https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5/) by [SAP](https://github.com/SAP/).\n\n> As of version `0.1.0`, we strive to share core functionality (such as webapp scaffolding) with [SAP's `open-ux-tools`](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools) effort, which is \"a set of tools and libraries that makes it faster and easier to develop SAP Fiori applications\".\n\n## Usage with easy-ui5\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo easy-ui5 project\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |--(o)--|    │  Welcome to the easy-ui5 │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\n![generation flow](./docs/embeddedUsage.gif)\n\nRun you can use `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the local server for development.\n\n## Standalone usage\n\nNote the different greeting when the generator starts.\n\n```bash\n$> npm i -g yo\n$> yo ./generator-ui5-project\n\n     _-----_     ╭──────────────────────────╮\n    |       |    │      Welcome to the      │\n    |--(o)--|    │     easy-ui5-project     │\n   `---------´   │        generator!        │\n    ( _´U`_ )    ╰──────────────────────────╯\n    /___A___\\   /\n     |  ~  |\n   __'.___.'__\n ´   `  |° ´ Y `\n```\n\n![generation flow](./docs/standaloneUsage.gif)\n\n## Target platforms\n\nDuring the prompting phase, the generator will ask on which target platform your app should run. Currently, the following options are available:\n\n### Static webserver\n\nThis is the most basic option. Choose this option if you want to deploy the web app in your custom environment or host it on an arbitrary server.\n\n### Application Router @ Cloud Foundry\n\nThis is the most basic way to deploy the web app in Cloud Foundry-based environments. Besides the basic UI5 project, the generator will add an [Approuter](https://github.com/gregorwolf/SAP-NPM-API-collection/tree/master/apis/approuter) node.js-module that serves the web app.\n\n### Application Router @ SAP HANA XS Advanced\n\nThis is the standard way to deploy the web app in SAP HANA XSA-based environments. Besides the basic UI5 project, the generator will add an [Approuter](https://github.com/gregorwolf/SAP-NPM-API-collection/tree/master/apis/approuter) node.js-module that serves the web app.\n\n### SAP HTML5 Application Repository service for SAP BTP\n\nThis option is a more sophisticate way to serve the web app from Cloud Foundry-based environments. The generator will include all modules that are included in the **Application Router @ Cloud Foundry** and, additionally, install a module to upload the web app to the HTML5 application repository during deploy-time. You can watch [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emnl-y9btdU&list=PLVf0R17F93RXT2tzhHzAr-iiYTmc9KngS&index=11&t=0s) to learn more about the benefits of using the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP Launchpad service\n\nUse this option if you would like to develop a Fiori Launchpad application that should run on Cloud Foundry. The generator will include all modules that are included in the **SAP HTML5 Application Repository service for SAP BTP** and, additionally, install a module that adds Fiori Launchpad resources to the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nUse this option if you want to deploy your application(s) to the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository.\n\n## Sub-generators to avoid recurring tasks\n\n### Add a new view\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new view (of the same type you specified during the creating of your project) and a new controller and route. If you have OPA5 tests, you can add a corresponding page object now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newview\n```\n\n### Create a custom control\n\nRun the following command from your project's root to scaffold a custom control.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newcontrol\n```\n\n### Add a new model\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new model in your manifest. Currently, [JSON](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel) and [OData v2](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel) models are supported with various configuration options.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newmodel\n```\n\n### Add a new component usage\n\nThis sub-generator will add a new component usage for component reuse to your manifest.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newcomponentusage\n```\n\n### OPA5 tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [OPA5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/topic/2696ab50faad458f9b4027ec2f9b884d) test setup. You can add page objects now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project opa5\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create an OPA5 page object and add it to your journeys:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newopa5po\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create an OPA5 journey and add it to your test page:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newopa5journey\n```\n\n### QUnit tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) setup. It will ask you for your app name and namespace if it is not yet part of an easy-ui5 project. You can add QUnit tests now or later with the `newqunittest` sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project qunit\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a new QUnit test either in a basic setup or with [Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org/) to create standalone test spies, stubs and mocks in your QUnit tests:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newqunittest\n```\n\n### UIVeri5 tests\n\nThis sub-generator will add a basic [UIVeri5](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-uiveri5) test. It will ask you for test configuration and names of the suite and spec. You can add page objects now or later with another sub-generator.\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project uiveri5\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a UIVeri5 page object and a new test that shows how to use the page object:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newuiveri5po\n```\n\nThis sub-generator will create a UIVeri5 spec file:\n\n```shell\n$> yo easy-ui5 project newuiveri5spec\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\nDepending on your target platform you'll need to install additional tools:\n\n### Cloud Foundry\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1. [Create a free account](https://developers.sap.com/mena/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) on SAP BTP Trial\n2. [Install](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface\n\n    ```shell\n    cf login\n    ```\n\n3. [Install](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin) the MultiApps CF CLI Plugin\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nCall this command from the root directory to deploy the application to Cloud Foundry\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n### SAP HANA XSA\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1. SAP HANA or [create a free](https://developers.sap.com/group.hxe-install-binary.html) SAP HANA Express system\n2. [Install](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-ua-install-xs-xli-client.html) the XS CLI Client\n\n    ```shell\n    $> xs login\n    ```\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nCall this command from the root directory to deploy the application to HANA XSA\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nDeployment steps:\n\nUpdate the ui5.yaml file with your system settings (user, password & server) and ABAP repository settings (package, BSP Container & Transport).\nRun following command to deploy the application to SAP NetWeaver\n\n```shell\n$> npm run deploy\n```\n\n## Shared functionality with SAP's `open-ux-tools`\n\n-   scaffolding a new webapp with view type `XML` uses [`@sap-ux/fiori-freestyle-writer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/fiori-freestyle-writer)\n\n## Embedded Technologies\n\nThis project leverages (among others) the following Open Source projects:\n\n-   [UI5 Build and Development Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling)\n-   [OpenUI5. Build Once. Run on any device.](https://github.com/SAP/openui5)\n-   [SAP open-ux-tool](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools)\n\n## Debugging the generator\n\nIf you want to modify and debug this (or any other Yeoman) generator, I recommend the following trick that leverages the capabilities of VS Code:\n\nYou need to add an `npm script` to trigger this generator from the \"npm scripts\" panel. To make your life a bit easier, I have already added such a script here.\n\n> Note that the generator will be called from the project root, which means all files will be generated here then. This might not be ideal in your situation, but you can always open another project in VS Code and add an npm script that calls this generator from there as well. Be aware that you need to change the path of the generator then.\n\nOnce the npm script is set up, you need to set a breakpoint in the logic of the generator itself (here in the index.js). Once all (conditional) breakpoints are set, hit the debug button of the npm script that you want to trigger. \n![debug](./docs/debugBreakpoint.png)\nWithin a few seconds, you'll see that the generator is started, and the debugger will be attached and eventually stop at your breakpoint. \n![debug](./docs/debugStopped.png)\n\nNow you are ready to go, happy coding 🦁!\n\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n[test-image]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg\n[test-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/actions/workflows/main.yml\n[prettier-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[prettier-url]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/blob/main/LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt\n[slack-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/openUI5-slack-yellow\n[slack-url]: https://openui5.slack.com\n[node-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D16-green?style=flat&logo=nodedotjs\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/\n[nvm-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/nvm-enabled-9cf?style=flat&logo=gnubash\n[nvm-url]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n[yeoman-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/easy--ui5-generator-red?style=flat&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[yeoman-url]: https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"generator-ui5-ts-app","version":"1.0.1","description":"Yeoman-based (sub-)generator for a basic UI5 application based on TypeScript","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"cd test && yo ../../generator-ui5-ts-app"},"keywords":["ui5","typescript","application","yeoman generator"],"author":"Peter Muessig <peter.muessig@sap.com>","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app.git"},"license":"apache-2.0","dependencies":{"chalk":"^5.1.2","glob":"^8.0.3","package-json":"^8.1.0","yeoman-generator":"^5.7.0","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@types/jest":"^29.2.2","jest":"^29.3.1","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^6.3.0"},"type":"generator","tags":["typescript"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-ts-app","forks":9,"stars":12,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2021-05-28T07:02:25Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-09T10:40:09Z","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app/tree/main/","readme":"# generator-ui5-ts-app\n\n[![License Status][license-image]][license-url]\n\nGenerator which use the official UI5 tooling and support multiple deployment targets such as the SAP Business Technology Platform.

It automatically benefits from all the available [UI5 Community generators](https://github.com/ui5-community/?q=generator-ui5&type=all&language=&sort=).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis NPM packages just adds a few more options to use the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator - but even a bit easier...\n\n### Option 1: Using `npm-init`\n\nThe [`npm-init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init) command is used to setup new repositories. You can use the `create-easy-ui5` package for `npm-init` like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm init easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 2: Using `npx`\n\nThe [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) command is used to run NPM packages directly and can be used to run the setup script:\n\n```sh\nnpx create-easy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\nThe `create-easy-ui5` package doesn't need to be installed upfront to be used as `npm-init` is downloading it automatically from the central NPM registry.\n\n### Option 3: Using `easy-ui5` binary\n\nThe `easy-ui5` binary is provided by the `create-easy-ui5` NPM package and once installed it can be used to setup new repositories using the Easy-UI5 Yeoman generator:\n\n```sh\n# Install create-easy-ui5\nnpm i -g create-easy-ui5\n\n# Run the binary\neasy-ui5 [template]\n```\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the LICENSE file.\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/create-easy-ui5.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/create-easy-ui5/blob/main/LICENSE\n","downloadsCurrentMonth":17,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":7,"downloads365":258,"downloadsFortnightGrowth":-30,"downloadsHistory":[{"yearMonth":"2021-12","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-01","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-02","downloads":0},{"yearMonth":"2022-03","downloads":71},{"yearMonth":"2022-04","downloads":24},{"yearMonth":"2022-05","downloads":24},{"yearMonth":"2022-06","downloads":13},{"yearMonth":"2022-07","downloads":30},{"yearMonth":"2022-08","downloads":31},{"yearMonth":"2022-09","downloads":23},{"yearMonth":"2022-10","downloads":31}],"npmlink":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-easy-ui5","versions":[{"version":"created","date":"2022-03-10T13:12:50.978Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-easy-ui5/v/created"},{"version":"1.0.0","date":"2022-03-10T13:12:51.126Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-easy-ui5/v/1.0.0"},{"version":"modified","date":"2022-04-27T20:22:36.521Z","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-easy-ui5/v/modified"}]},{"name":"generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl","version":"1.0.1","description":"Yeoman-based (sub-)generator for a UI5 TypeScript application using the FlexibleColumnLayout","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"cd test && yo ../../generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl"},"keywords":["ui5","typescript","application","yeoman generator"],"author":"Wouter Lemaire <wouter@lemaire.tech>, Peter Muessig <peter.muessig@sap.com>","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl.git"},"license":"apache-2.0","dependencies":{"axios":"^0.24.0","chalk":"^4.1.2","package-json":"^7.0.0","x2js":"^3.4.2","xmldom":"^0.6.0","xpath":"^0.0.32","yeoman-generator":"^5.5.2","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"@types/jest":"^27.4.0","jest":"^27.4.5","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^6.2.0"},"type":"generator","tags":["typescript"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl","forks":0,"stars":1,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2022-01-03T17:27:15Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-10T14:45:33Z","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl/tree/main/","readme":"# generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl\n\n[![License Status][license-image]][license-url]\n\nGenerator which use the official UI5 tooling and support multiple deployment targets such as the SAP Business Technology Platform.

You will be able to select one as your main EntitySet. The Master page will show a list of all entries in this EntitySet, while the detail page will show the details of the selected entry.\n### Key\nThe next option is the key. You'll have to select the field you would like to use as the main key. This will be used in the routing configuration as parameter to navigate to the detail page.\n### Title\nThe title option will be bound to the title in the list as well as on the detail page.\n### Other Field\nThis last one is an open and free field to bind a second field to the table and on the detail page. It can be a numbe or a description of the title. Just one additional field to kickstart your project!\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this generator equally.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the LICENSE file.\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl.svg\n[license-url]: https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app-fcl/blob/main/LICENSE\n\n---------------------------\n###### This generator is provided to you by Peter Muessig and Wouter Lemaire","downloadsCurrentMonth":-1,"downloadsCurrentFortnight":-1,"downloads365":-1},{"name":"generator-template-ui5-flp-plugin","version":"0.0.1","description":"(Sub-)generator for a UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin","scripts":{"test":"mocha","workaround":"find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete","test:manual":"cd test/ui5-app && ui5 serve","prettier":"prettier --write ."},"keywords":["yeoman-generator","sap","sapui5","openui5","ui5","project-template","flp-plugin","fiori-launchpad-plugin"],"author":"SAP (Amar Ubhe)","license":"apache-2.0","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin.git"},"files":["helpers","generators"],"dependencies":{"chalk":"^4.1.0","glob":"^7.1.6","object-assign-deep":"^0.4.0","valid-filename":"^3.1.0","yaml":"^1.10.2","yeoman-environment":"^3.2.0","yeoman-generator":"^4.13.0","yosay":"^2.0.2"},"devDependencies":{"execa":"^5.0.0","mocha":"^8.3.2","prettier":"2.2.1","yeoman-assert":"^3.1.1","yeoman-test":"^3.0.0"},"type":"generator","tags":["flp"],"gitHubOwner":"ui5-community","gitHubRepo":"generator-ui5-flp-plugin","forks":0,"stars":2,"addedToBoUI5":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.007Z","createdAt":"2021-07-05T15:02:32Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-03T09:41:01Z","githublink":"https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-flp-plugin/tree/main/","readme":"# Generator for SAPUI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin\n> Generator for UI5 Fiori Launchpad Plugin using UI5 Tooling.

Currently, the following options are available:\n\n### Static webserver\n\nThis is the most basic option. Choose this option if you want to deploy the web app in your custom environment or host it on an arbitrary server.\n\n### SAP Launchpad service\n\nUse this option if you would like to develop a Fiori Launchpad application that should run on Cloud Foundry. The generator will install a module that adds Fiori Launchpad resources to the HTML5 application repository.\n\n### SAP NetWeaver\n\nUse this option if you want to deploy your application(s) to the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Repository.\n\n## Test Application\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\nDepending on your target platform you'll need to install additional tools:\n\n### Cloud Foundry\n\nRequired tools:\n\n1. [Create a free account](https://developers.sap.com/mena/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) on SAP BTP Trial\n2.
